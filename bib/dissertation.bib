  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Eukaryotes use distinct networks of biogenesis
              factors to synthesize, fold, monitor, traffic, and secrete
              proteins. During heterologous expression, saturation of any of
              these networks may bottleneck titer and yield. To understand the
              flux through various routes into the early secretory pathway, we
              quantified the global and membrane-associated translatomes of
              Komagataella phaffii. RESULTS: By coupling Ribo-seq with
              long-read mRNA sequencing, we generated a new annotation of
              protein-encoding genes. By using Ribo-seq with subcellular
              fractionation, we quantified demands on co- and posttranslational
              translocation pathways. During exponential growth in rich media,
              protein components of the cell-wall represent the greatest number
              of nascent chains entering the ER. Transcripts encoding the
              transmembrane protein PMA1 sequester more ribosomes at the ER
              membrane than any others. Comparison to Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              reveals conservation in the resources allocated by gene ontology,
              but variation in the diversity of gene products entering the
              secretory pathway. CONCLUSION: A subset of host proteins,
              particularly cell-wall components, impose the greatest
              biosynthetic demands in the early secretory pathway. These
              proteins are potential targets in strain engineering aimed at
              alleviating bottlenecks during heterologous protein production.",
